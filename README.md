Smart Shopping Basket

The product of our project smart shopping basket, which is a scanner that is mounted to a shopping basket with the help of IoT and pervasive engineering. The reason we decided to execute the project is to help social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic in Jakarta. So, we created this product to create a new method of payment in the cashier to decrease human interaction.

The product’s components are: <br/>
Arduino UNO R3 <br/>
